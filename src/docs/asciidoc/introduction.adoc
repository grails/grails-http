The Grails HTTP project provides a set of core utility classes for dealing with the HTTP protocol.

From a user perspective, the current most useful of these is an Asynchronous HTTP client built on Netty that integrates seamlessly with Grails framework.

Note that this client does not require Grails itself, and can easily be used standalone or as an independent HTTP client.
