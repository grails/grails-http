To facilitate testing and mocking you can use the link:groovydoc/grails/http/client/test/TestAsyncHttpBuilder.html[TestAsyncHttpBuilder] class.

The `TestAsyncHttpBuilder` provides the ability to mock HTTP responses and avoid external HTTP requests within your unit tests.

For example:

[source,groovy]
TestAsyncHttpBuilder client = new TestAsyncHttpBuilder()
client.expect {
    uri '/foo/bar'
    method "GET"
    accept 'application/json'
}.respond {
    ok()
    json {
        title "Hello"
    }
}
...
Promise<HttpClientResponse> p = client.get("https://localhost:8080/foo/bar") {
    accept 'application/json'
}
HttpClientResponse response = p.get()
...
assert client.verify()
assert response.status == HttpStatus.OK
assert response.json.title == "Hello"
