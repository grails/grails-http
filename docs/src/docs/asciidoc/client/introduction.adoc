The HTTP client is built on the http://netty.io[Netty toolkit] and is designed as a non-blocking replacement for the https://grails.org/plugin/rest-client-builder[REST Client Builder plugin ] for Grails.

To get started with the HTTP client you should declare a dependency on the `grails-http` project in your `build.gradle` file:

[source,groovy]
compile "org.grails:grails-http:VERSION"

The entry point for the API is the link:api/grails/http/client/AsyncHttpBuilder.html[AsyncRestBuilder] class.

NOTE: Typically there should be a single instance of this class ( a Spring bean for example) that you reuse to avoid the cost of repeatedly creating the thread pools that Netty requires to operate.

The most simple use case for obtaining content can be seen below:

[source,groovy]
import grails.http.client.*
import grails.async.*
...
AsyncHttpBuilder client = new AsyncHttpBuilder()
Promise<HttpClientResponse> p = client.post("https://localhost:8080/foo/bar") {
    contentType 'application/json'
    json {
        title "Ping"
    }
}
p.onComplete { HttpClientResponse resp ->
    assert resp.json.title == 'Pong'
}

The `AsyncHttpBuilder` has methods for each HTTP method type (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT` etc.), each one returning a http://grails.github.io/grails-doc/latest/api/grails/async/Promise.html[Promise].

You can attach completion or error listeners to the `Promise` instance. For more information on promises see http://grails.github.io/grails-doc/latest/guide/async.html#promises[the guide] in the Grails documentation.
