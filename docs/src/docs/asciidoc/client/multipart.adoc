To send a request of type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` use the `form` method defined by link:api/grails/http/client/builder/HttpRequestBuilder.html[HttpRequestBuilder]:

[source,groovy]
Promise<HttpClientResponse> p = client.post("http://localhost:8080/foo/bar") {
    form {
        foo = "bar"
    }
}

To upload files using a multipart request use the `multipart` method:

[source,groovy]
client.post("http://localhost:8080/foo/bar") {
    multipart {
        foo = "bar"
        myFile = new File(..)
    }
}

You can either assign a `File`, an `InputStream` or a `byte[]` for files to be uploaded. Alternatively you can use the `file` method of `HttpRequestBuilder` to further customize the file upload.
